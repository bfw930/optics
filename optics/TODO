outstanding development requirements


optical model

	define and develop translation from optical model parameters to clinical prescription

	refine required variable parameters within optical model for each defined optical test


ray-tracing engine

	update ellipsiod refraction calculation (ray-ellipsoid intersection point) to use complete separation of
	transformation matricies for translation, rotation, and scale; test to ensure accuracy

	accurately impliment rotation for optical element rotation, enable optical axis parameter for front cornea


image translation

	improve efficiency of image translation process; overhaul subsampling and pixel binning given only greyscale
	image; reduce number of required rays based on image distance and size;

	develop batch process for image database generation for a given optical test; generate initial image batches
