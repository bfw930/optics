outstanding development requirements


optical model

	define and develop translation from optical model parameters to clinical prescription

	refine required variable parameters within optical model for each defined optical test

	update reverse optics as delta of initial parameter rather than new value


ray-tracing engine

	update ellipsiod refraction calculation (ray-ellipsoid intersection point) to use complete separation of
	transformation matricies for translation, rotation, and scale; test to ensure accuracy

	accurately impliment rotation for optical element rotation, enable optical axis parameter for front cornea

	improve efficiency of reverse ray calculation


image translation

	improve efficiency of image translation process; overhaul subsampling and pixel binning given only greyscale
	image; reduce number of required rays based on image distance and size;

	develop batch process for image database generation for a given optical test; generate initial image batches


	look into transformation mapping using approximate function rather than implicit ray tracing




'''

    import test image and supersample (1 px to 9 rays) initial positions

    define standard optical parameters

    calculate ray paths, final retinal image locations

    store retinal pixel map at standard optics


    adjust optical parameters for stigmatism

    set initial ray locations as standard retinal image

    calculate ray paths in reverse (retina to image location)

    save pixel map for optical configuration


    use pixel map to subsample over image grid, generate image pixels from average of standard pixels


    build database of pixel maps for given range and step of optical parameters each stigmatism

    generate image translation suit for given input image (greyscale) using pixel maps (parameter dependent)

## import test image



## get mapping of test image to initial ray points


# define length of image dimensions (allow scale of image, bin average pixels per region)
# uniform divide pixels into spatial map of initial ray y,z coordinates




## calculate retinal projection of image, mapping of image to retina




## display retinal image projection: wide focus and fovea zoom




## generate inverted optics chain (ray start retinal image mapping)



## reverse path trace retinal image back to origin

#### confirm accurate mapping to original image



## vary optics parameters in forward / reverse optics chain, compare image to retinal image mapping, distortion



## develop methodology to recreate perceptive refraction image for clinical testing
# test image baseline retinal mapping
# inverse optic parameter variation through reverse optics chain
# generate perceptive distortion image for display


## generate test image sweep over parameter space for distorted image set
