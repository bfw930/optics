summary of project: __optical model of subjective refraction for clinical prescription determination__



	__project objectives__

		develop clinical testing methodology and underlying core technology to accurately determine optical prescription parameters to correct for subjective refraction using only 2-dimensionl test images presented to a user via a web interface in real-time



	__new knowledge__

		develop __testing methodology__ for determining optical prescription parameters to correct for subjective refraction, capable of being performed using only the presentation of 2-dimensional images through a web interface

			simulate optical distortion of arbitrary test imges due to subjective refraction

			perform statistical regression of user subjective refraction through the presentation of inverse distorted images to a user

			receive user input for optical model parameter adjustments and update the presented image distortion in real-time

			perform statistical evaluation for convergence of user provided optical model parameters to accurately determine optical prescription required to correct of user subjective refraction abnormalities


		develop __optical model for human eye system__ that accurately reflects human vision to a level sufficient to account for subjective refraction at the limits of visual acuity

			research and aggregate existing optical models for the human eye system, developed through the clinical study and evaluation of population eye testing data

			through the lens of subjective refraction and optical defocus, validate the optical models for required accuracy and optical (computational) complexity

			develop a focused and computationaly efficieny optical model for accurately simulating subjective refraction that is physically based and aligned to aggregate test data derived from clinical studies


		develop __physically based path tracing engine__, capable of accurately simulating subjective refraction of images through the human eye optical model, capable of generating accurately distorted images with a sub-perceptual resolution

			develop a physically based path tracing engine that accurately simulates point-to-point light ray propagation within a space, including transmissive refraction at the intersection of optical components with differing refractive index

			develop a simulation protocol for chaining the propagation of batch light ray fields through an optical model comprising multiple successive optical elements

			translate the mathematical foundations of the developed optical model of the human eye into the framework of the developed path tracing engine, incorporating variable parameters that are directly linked to optical stigmatisms within the desired suit of optical tests to be performed

			develop a protocol for generating (or importing) target optical test images, subsampling these into a light ray field for propagation through the path tracing engine, obtain a standard reference transmision profile, simulate inverse propagation with optical parameter variation, and resample the distorted test images in batch over an optical test parameter range



	__technical uncertainty__

		primary technical uncertainties relating to the new knowledge included:

			real-time image translation based on user input

				computational complexity and therefore processing time of path tracing process

				responsiveness of image transmission and presentation over web interface

				reliability of protcol under heavy and variable server load scenarios


			optical model accuracy in simulating subjective refraction

				computational complexity of path tracing process sufficient to accuratly simulate subjective refraction to the level required for prescription determination (parameter range, step size)


			clinical testing methodology for determining subjective refraction through only the use of 2-dimensional images

				fundamental uncertainty regarding core ideas of clinical testing methodology its capability in achieving statistically valid and accurate prescription for subjective refraction, based solely off user response to 2-dimensional images

				user perception of image distortion at a clinically relevant level of accuracy under highly variable test conditions and setting (user defined, limited control of environment, calibration accuracy limitations)



	__core activity__

				__continuing activities - (refine optical model if determined as required from feedback within clincial testing phase)__


			implimentation and testing of optical model within path tracing engine

				develop specific functionality required for light ray field path tracing through the developed optical model

				test limits of path tracing through optical model at the expected parameter limits required for clinical testing

				develop algorithms for automated ray discarding to improve computational efficiency and reliability

				__status - (optical model implimented within path tracing engine, tested and capable of performing physically realistic subjective refraction simulations for batch light ray fields, limitations on single pass simulation at sufficient resolution / accuracy require > 10s per image, insufficieny efficiency for real-time applications at this stage)__

				__continuing activities - (further algorithm development to improve simulation performance)__


			development and testing of image translation protocols for optical model parameter based distortion

				validate reference image translation accuracy based on statistical testing and perceptual assessment

				develop and test image-to-ray decomposition, subsampling, and image resampling algorithms for computational efficiency, optical parameter range limit reliability, and subjective perceptual accuracy

				__status - (image translation accuracy acceptable for low-resolution images, however computational performance and efficieny limitations currently hinder real-time applications, resorted to batch image dataset pre-generation and key-map file lookup for initial clinical testing)__

				__continuing activities - (further algorithm development to improve image translation efficiency / accuracy)__
